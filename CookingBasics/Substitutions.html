	<div class="DESCRIPTION">
		First of all, there are 2 basic measurement systems we deal with. <span class="NOTE">(And tons that we don't.)</span>
		They are Metric <span class="NOTE">(with things like liters and grams)</span> and English <span class="NOTE">(with things like cups and pounds)</span>.
		Traditionally, the United States used the English measurement system for everything.
		Then came along Metric and the geeks were sold on how much sense it makes and how easy it is to use.
		However, Americans are slow to change, especially to things that are logical, so we continue to use English for just about everything.
		This definitely includes cooking at this point, and I don't see any sign of that changing.

	<div class="SECTION_HEADER">English Conversions</div>
	<div class="DESCRIPTION">
		The basis and patterns for the English measurement system are pretty obscure to us today, and frankly, I suspect it didn't make a lot of sense to begin with.
		For example, why are there <b><i>12</i></b> Inches in a Foot, then <b><i>3</i></b> Feet in a Yard, then <b><i>1760</i></b> yards in a mile, etc.?
		Unfortunately, that means having to memorize or look up conversions.
		<br />
		Hopefully, this will help.

	<div class="SUBSECTION_HEADER">Volume</div>
	<div class="DESCRIPTION">
		<p style="margin-bottom:0;">
			Volume is what is used most in recipes. Cups, teaspoons, etc.
		</p>
		<p class="NOTE" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
			Note: To make things complicated, there are two kinds of "Ounces".
			One is a measure of weight, the other a measure of a liquid's volume.
			To distinguish between the two, the volume measurement is usually referred to as "Fluid Ounces" or "Fl. Oz."
		</p>
		<div class="NOTE" style="margin:0 0 0 2em;">
			Fun note: One Fluid Ounce of water weighs about 1 Ounce, but that conversion may not work for other liquids, such as oil, molasses, etc.
		</div>
		<p>
			On this chart, each row has equal measurements.
			For example, 32 Fl. Oz. is the same as 192 teaspoons.
			And that is the same as 64 Tablespoons, which is the same as 4 Cups, which is the same as 2 Pints and so on.

	<div class="SECTION_HEADER">Substitutions</div>
	<div class="DESCRIPTION">
		<p>
			Conversions, in the previous section, have to do with determining that two things that are equal.
			On the other hand, substitutions are for when you want things that may not be exactly the same, but are similar, and may be more convenient for your situation.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here's an example:
			<br />
			When I first did the <a class="no-print" href="../beverages/RootBeer.xml">Root Beer</a><span class="no-screen">Root Beer</span> recipe, I would buy the sugar specifically for the recipe.
			That is one 10-lb. bag.
			But later, I would buy my sugar 25 lbs. at a time.
			That would make it so I always had what I needed on-hand and got it at a cheaper rate since I bought in bulk.
			<br />
			I didn't want to bother with just going to the store to get a 10-lb. bag.
			Turns out, 10 lbs. of sugar is just short of 20 cups.
			So I can "substitute" 1 lb. of sugar with 2 cups of sugar.
			It isn't <i>exactly</i> the same, but it is close enough, and a lot more convenient.
		</p>
		<p>
			Another, more diverse example:
			While I was a missionary in Puerto Rico, I once wanted to bake my favorite <a class="no-print" href="../desserts/RangerCookies.xml">Ranger Cookies</a><span class="no-screen">Ranger Cookies</span>.
			Unfortunately, the recipe calls for Brown Sugar, and in my area it just wasn't to be found.
			Well, regular Sugar works a lot like Brown Sugar, but it definitely doesn't taste the same.
			I was able to find some really dark honey that was tangy like Brown Sugar, but wouldn't work the same. <i>(Who wants syrupy cookies?)</i>
			However, I was able to find a mixture of the two that while not exactly like Brown Sugar, was close enough for my Ranger Cookies.
		</p>
		<p>
			One final note:
			<br />
			I try to keep these generic, but not all Substitutions will work with all recipes.
			You may need to do some testing to be sure.
