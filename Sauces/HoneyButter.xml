	<Notes id="Notes">
		<note> Make sure Butter is softened before starting this recipe. This is best done by leaving a stick on the counter for an hour or so. <br /> Use caution if you choose to soften in a microwave. <span class="SUPER_EMPHASIZE">Do not melt the Butter!</span> This will just make everything a coagulated ugly mess. </note>
