<Summary>
	<p> The VanOrmans <span class="SUPER_EMPHASIZE">love</span> to go camping. So cooking outdoors is one of our things. <span class="NOTE">(Di <u>doesn't</u> like the camping, but she does like the outdoor cooking since she gets to sit back for a change.)</span></p>
	<p> We especially <span class="SUPER_EMPHASIZE">love</span> to do Dutch Oven cooking! <br /> The VanOrmans have been doing it since Ransom was about 12 years old. In that time, we have gathered several award-winning recipes, and have made up several recipes of our own. </p>
