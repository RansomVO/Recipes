	<Notes id="Notes">
		<note>If necessary, you can let the Roast rest in step 6 for up to 45 minutes.</note>
		<note>
			"Prime" is actually a quality. So "Prime Rib" is a very high quality of Rib Roast.
			As such, if you are price conscious, ask for a "Rib Roast" at the store.
			It really doesn't matter much if it is "Prime", "Choice", "Select" or something else.

	<Modifications id="Modifications">
		<modification>For a little extra flavor, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of fresh Rosemary on the top of the Roast just before placing it in the oven the first time.</modification>
