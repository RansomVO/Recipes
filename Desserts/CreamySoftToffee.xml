		<note>
			<span class="SUPER_EMPHASIZE">Warning!</span> Mixture will more than double while heating, then will reduce as it nears the correct temperature, so make sure you use a <span class="SUPER_EMPHASIZE">Large</span> non-stick pot. </note>
		<note>Cutting it up is a challenge. At first, I used a hot, large, sharp, chopping knife, and was able to get it if I was patient.<br />Then I found if you waited until was nearly cool you can use a Pizza Cutter to do the primary cutting.<br /><span class="NOTE"><span class="EMPHASIZE">NOTE</span>: If you leave the edges touching, they will merge back together. </span></note>
