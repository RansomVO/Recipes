	<Notes>
		<note>In Step 3, if you add the powder directly into the Boiling Water, it may " flash boil". <br />This will cause it to spray all over and somebody usually gets burned.<br /><span class=" NOTE">(Believe me, I learned the hard way!)</span></note>

	<Modifications id=" Modifications">
		<modification>Instead of cutting Jigglers into rectangles, use cookie cutters to cut into decorative shapes.</modification>
		<modification><span class=" POINT_HIGHLIGHT">To make the treats more nutritious <span class=" NOTE">(and better tasting)</span></span>:<br />Use some sort of fruit Juice instead of water.</modification>
