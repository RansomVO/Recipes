	<Description id="Description">
		When I was young, my dad used to cook some wonderful recipes in the Dutch Oven.
		We were constantly looking for recipes that could be adapted.
		One year we decided to try pizza and it turned out wonderful.
		At that time, our favorite was GodFather's Pizza.
		Some of us commented that it was better than GodFather's.
		My dad responded, "Of course, it came from a Dutch Oven. It's Dutch Father's Pizza," and the name stuck.

	<Notes id="Notes">
		<note>It is best to make the sauce the night before you use it.</note>
		<note>A 2-inch-thick 12&inch; pizza will feed 4 adults <span class="NOTE">(or 2 Boy Scouts. <span class="EMPHASIZE">Not Kidding!</span>)</span>.</note>
		<note>The thicker the pizza, the slower it must be cooked. I made one where each layer of toppings obscured the layer below. It was over 3 inches thick and took over an hour to cook. It sure was good though. &smiley;<br />CAUTION: The most common problem is over-cooking the <span class="EMPHASIZE">bottom</span>.</note>
		<note>Use left-over sauce as a dipping sauce for the Pizza crusts.</note>
		<note>Use the left-over dough to make <a href=".../Camping/Desserts/Twisties.xml">"Twisties"</a></note>
