	<Description id="Description"> Corn chips are pretty boring by themselves. They are great with salsa, but after a while, even that gets old. We have purchased all sorts of dips, such as nacho cheese, for corn chips, but nothing really had that "wow" we wanted. <br /> Then, at a party, we tried a dip that really impressed us. We asked around and found out it was "homemade" and we coaxed the recipe out of them. </Description>

	<Notes id="Notes">
		<note>Do not use Plain Cheese, such as Cheddar. It turns into a glob instead of a spread.</note>
		<note>Do not use Nacho Cheese. It turns into a soup instead of a spread.</note>
		<note>Chunky salsa is usually more appealing.</note>
		<note>You can use Mild, Medium, or Hot Salsa, depending on your preference.</note>
