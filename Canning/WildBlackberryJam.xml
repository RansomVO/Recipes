		</note>
		<note>If you let the jam boil too long, it will not "set" and you end up with runny syrup instead of jam.</note>
		<note>We do not recommend using liquid pectin. When we do, we have had problems getting it to set.</note>
		<note>Instead of mashing fruit, you can place fruit in a blender and blend it for a few seconds until it is just barely liquefied.</note>
		<note>The Lemon Juice raises the acidity level of the jam so it will not spoil when stored.</note>
		<note>If you have a big enough pot, there is no reason that you can't double the recipe.</note>
