	<Description id="Description">
		We have tried many different recipes for Peanut Butter Cookies.
		Josh found this recipe and although he used the correct ingredients, he totally ignored the directions and did things his own way.
		The results were quite different from anything else we have tried.
		The cookies are a lot thinner than others, and they are a bit crispy on the bottom and edges.
		They are now Di's all-time favorite.
