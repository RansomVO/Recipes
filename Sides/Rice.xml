	<Description id="Description"> It wasn't until my mission that I found out how much of a difference there is between Minute Rice, and real Rice. In Puerto Rico, <span class="HIGHLIGHT">nobody</span> uses Minute Rice because its taste and consistency are <span class="EMPHASIZE">terrible</span> compared to the real stuff. <br /> Rice is cheap, can be stored for years and years before it is cooked, and it's a great, generic side dish. </Description>
