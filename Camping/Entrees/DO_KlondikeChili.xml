	<Description id="Description">This is Ransom's second Chili recipe. The first one was really good, but it was complex and actually had to be started the day before you wanted to eat it. <span class="NOTE">(Additionally, most people found it to be too spicy.)</span> <span class="NOTE">(See <a href="../Entrees/SlowCooker/StealthAttackChili.xml">Entrees / Slow Cooker: Stealth-Attack Chili</a>.)</span> <br /> This recipe is geared towards quick preparation, and has actually won the first-place award at multiple Boy Scout district Dutch-oven chili cook-offs! </Description>

	<Notes id="Notes">
		<note>
			Cilantro purchased from the grocery store comes in a bunch of stems.
			The leaves need to be picked from the stems and the stems can be discarded.
			Then the leaves need to be chopped.
		</note>
		<note> The Onions and Peppers should be cut into chunks that are as large as possible, but still easy to get into a spoon. <ul>
				<li>1" &times; 1" is too big.</li>
				<li>&frac18;" &times; &frac18;" is too small.</li>
			</ul>
			<span class="NOTE">(We generally use &frac12;" &times; &frac12;", but don't hesitate to make them bigger if you want.)</span>
		</note>
		<note> After chopping the Peppers, <span class="EMPHASIZE">be very careful to <span class="SUPER_EMPHASIZE">not</span> rub your eyes!</span> Even after washing your hands thoroughly, the spicy oils will still be there, and it will <span class="SUPER_EMPHASIZE">hurt!</span></note>
		<note>To make cooking faster and easier, you can do some prep ahead a time: <span class="NOTE">(Do this for Scout outings.)</span><ul>

			<li>Cut up Onions</li>
			<li>Cook Hamburger and Onions, let cool, then put in a Ziplock bag.</li>
