	<Notes id="Notes">
		<note>Be absolutely certain to remove 1 Cup of the Filling mixture before drizzling! Using all of it will ruin the cake. (On the other hand, you can use the leftover for whatever you want: Dipping sliced apples, pouring over sliced bananas, eating with a spoon, whatever.</note>
