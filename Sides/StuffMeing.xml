	<Description id="Description">
		Most Thanksgivings we have used boxes of Stove Top Stuffing, but one year we ate at our in-laws, the Therriault's, and fell in love with their stuffing.
		She gave us her recipe and we made some modifications to make it completely on the stove instead of stuffing it into the Turkey.
		That makes it StuffMeing instead of Stuffing. &smiley;
