	<Description id="Description"> We love eating Chinese food. We usually use bottle after bottle of Yoshida's sauce. But one night, we started making Teriyaki chicken and found we didn't have any!<br />So Ransom decided to try making his own. The first try was excellent, and the second was even better, but the third time topped them all! <br /> Since it is better than Yoshida's sauce, and since it was made by "Daddy," we decided to call it Daddyda's Sauce. </Description>
