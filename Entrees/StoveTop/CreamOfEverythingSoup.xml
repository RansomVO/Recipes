	<Description id="Description"> In general, Di doesn't like to eat soup. It isn't that she doesn't like soup, it is just that she wants to eat something else. But, there is one exception: When it is cold, windy and rainy, she feels it is time to eat soup. <br /> One such day, Di and Ransom started debating what kind of soup to make. Di wanted a plain Cream of Broccoli soup. Ransom, on the other hand, was not in the mood for anything plain, so he made up this recipe. </Description>
