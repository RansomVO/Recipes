	<Notes id="Notes">
		<note> When at home, the Ice Cream Maker can be electric so nobody has to do any work to chill it.<br />When outdoors <span class="NOTE">(like camping or picnics)</span>, there are also hand-crank Ice Cream Makers. But, you have to make sure they are constantly being cranked, so you'll want several people to take turns. &smiley; </note>

	<Modifications id="Modifications">
		<modification>Chilling time is less if you let it sit and cool for a while before putting in the Ice Cream Maker.</modification>
		<modification>If you double the recipe, you can fit it all into a 6-Quart Ice Cream Maker</modification>
		<modification>It is great by itself, but is a big kick if you serve it next to a hot dessert or if you serve it with toppings like fruit, chocolate syrup, caramel, etc.</modification>
