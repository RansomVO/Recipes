		<p> Over the years the VanOrman family has acquired a large number of recipes. At first, we gathered them from friends and family. And we even started inventing recipes of our own! Later, we found some on the internet. Originally, Ransom made a web site containing a number of these. <br /> But, as time went on and smaller devices became more prevelent, we found it wasn't very convenient to try to read recipes from a phone while you are cooking. &#x1F600; </p>
		<p> When we had the first missionary in our family <i>(Rachel)</i> Ransom started a VanOrman Family Recipe book as a recipe book for missionaries from the <a class="no-print" href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/">Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a><span class="no-screen">Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</span>. We started with some extremely basic recipes because we knew that some missionaries had no experience with cooking, and we wanted them to be able to participate in the cooking experience. We have shared this with a large number of missionaries that have come through our area. <br /> Then we expanded the book to contain everything that we come up with. <br /> But then, it became more difficult to share individual recipes, especially with remote people. </p>

			<i>Eventually</i>, Ransom figured out how to get the recipes all on a website, <b>
				<i>and</i>
			</b> make them printable! </p>
		<p> Currently, you'll find a wide range of recipes. We have also added a lot of information about basic ingredients, cooking tools and methods, etc. <br /> &hellip;And, we are constantly adding more! <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>(As such, if you see "ToDo" <span class="FINE_PRINT">(or "todo" or "TODO" or "QZX" or ...)</span>, that means it is something that has been started but still has work to do.)</i>
