	<Description id="Description"> In the mid 1800's, the U.S. government was dealing with Navajo Indians by commandeering the women and children and marching them to a distant location. On the trip, they were given small allotments of flour, etc. From this, the mothers would mix up a dough and fry it in oil for their children. <br /> There are several versions of this recipe, but this is the one that has worked best for us. </Description>
