	<Description id="Description">
		While thumbing through the World-Wide Ward Cookbook we saw a recipe for a Rice side dish that sounded pretty good.
		We tried it and the kids went ga-ga.
		And it is really easy.
		It is just the basic recipe for Rice, with a few extra ingredients tossed in at the start.
		So, when we do Rice as a side dish, this is the one we almost always do.

	<Notes id="Notes">
		<note>At the start, it looks like way too much vegetables for the Rice, but once it cooks, and you stir it up, it ends up being just right.</note>
		<note>The lid needs to stay in place to keep heat and moisture mostly contained.</note>
		<note>The slower the Rice simmers, the better. If you do it too hot, the Rice at the bottom will burn.</note>
		<note>Do not stir Rice while it is cooking.</note>
	</Notes>
