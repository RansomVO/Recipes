	<Notes id="Notes">
		<note> When used as a Pizza Sauce, the Garlic and Onion must be <span class="HIGHLIGHT">finely</span> minced to avoid making the Sauce chunky. <br /> Or: <ul>
				<li>Instead of Garlic, you can use the same amount of Garlic Powder.</li>
				<li>Instead of Onion, you can use the same amount of Onion Powder.</li>
			</ul>
		</note>
		<note> The sauce can be made ahead of time and kept in the fridge for several days. <br /> This means you can make a large batch, then use it for Pizza one day, Spaghetti the next, etc. </note>
