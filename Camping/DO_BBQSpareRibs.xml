	<Description id="Description">
		When Jennie was growing up, her mom used to make a wonderful BBQ Spare Ribs recipe.
		After we were married, she shared the recipe with us, but when we made it, it turned out totally different.
		It turns out that instead of using Tomato Paste, like the recipe calls for, she always used Tomato Sauce, so it was runny and didn't taste as good.

	<Notes id="Notes">
		<note>CAUTION: If you over-cook the ribs they will begin to fall apart, and you end up with shredded BBQ pork or beef.</note>
		<note>When serving the ribs, the extra sauce tastes wonderful over baked potatoes, with a dollop of sour cream.</note>
