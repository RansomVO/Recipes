	<Notes id="Notes">
		<note>
			Potatoes are usually mashed with a potato masher, but I find it easier to use a mixer.
			If you don't have either, you can use a fork, but that is painful.
		</note>
		<note>
			The goal is to finish mashing Potatoes, browning Hamburger and heating Peas at the same time.
			That way, the Shepherd's Pie is already hot when it is assembled.

		<modification>
			Instead of Golden Mushroom Soup, you can use simple Brown Gravy with Salt and Pepper.
			Or better yet, Brown Gravy with Montreal Steak Seasoning.
		</modification>
		<modification>
			Instead of Peas, you can use just about any vegetable:
			Corn, Green Beans, even Mixed Vegetables.
		</modification>
		<modification>
			If you do not have a microwave available, or if you don't have a microwave safe 9&inch; &by; 9&inch; pan, heat the Peas in a separate pan with a little water.
			Then drain and place in 9&inch; &by; 9&inch; pan.
