	<Description id="Description">"Jardinero" is the Spanish word for gardener. It is pronounced "Har-dee-neh-row".<br />Ransom prepared this recipe once when he had been out on his mission in Puerto Rico for only a couple of months. His senior companion just about died of pleasure. He said it was the first "real American" meal he had had in over a year!<br />Later, some members told Ransom what the name of the dish is in Spanish.</Description>
