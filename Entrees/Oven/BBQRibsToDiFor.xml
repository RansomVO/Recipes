	<Description id="Description">Before they were married Di and Ransom had a BBQ Rips bake-off with missionaries as the judges. Ransom did the <a href=".../Entrees/SlowCooker/BBQSpareRibs.xml">Slow Cooker BBQ Spare Ribs recipe</a>. Di did one similar to this one. She won, but then <span class="NOTE">(a long time later)</span> Di told Ransom that her sauce recipe was something like: "Buy a bottle of Tony Roma BBQ Sauce". <br /> Ransom tried her method and found it did give the ribs a great consistency, so, after several attempts, we came up with this recipe to go with her cooking instructions.</Description>

	<Notes id="Notes">
		<note>Do the first part of the Ribs <span class="NOTE">(steps 1-8)</span>, then, during the baking <span class="NOTE">(step 8)</span> make the Sauce and let it sit until it is time to use it.</note>
		<note>
			When serving, place the Ribs on a platter, then pour/scrape the leftover Sauce into a bowl with a gravy ladle.
			It can be used by those that want extra Sauce, or it is great over a baked potato with sour cream.
		</note>
		<note>
			In step 8 of the Ribs instructions, you can take the water, pour it into a bowl and refrigerate it.
			The next day, it makes a great base for soup once you scoop the fat from the top.
