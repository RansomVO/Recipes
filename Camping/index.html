	<div class="DESCRIPTION">
		<p>
			The VanOrmans <span class="SUPER_EMPHASIZE">love</span> to go camping.
			So cooking outdoors is one of our things.
			<span class="NOTE">(My wife likes it too since she gets to sit back for a change.)</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			We especially <span class="SUPER_EMPHASIZE">love</span> to do Dutch Oven cooking!
			<br />
			The VanOrmans have been doing it since Ransom was about 12 years old.
			In that time, we have gathered several award-winning recipes, and have made up several recipes of our own.
