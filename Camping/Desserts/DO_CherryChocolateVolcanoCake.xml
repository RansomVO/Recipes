	<Description id="Description"> When there was a Dutch oven cook-off for desserts at a ward campout, Ransom tried doing a simple twist on upside-down cake. It was a huge hit! <br /> As we tried to serve it, the Pie Filling started to drip down the side of the cake, thus the name. <!-- QZX --><div class="TODO">The Ingredient amounts need to be validated.</div><!-- QZX -->

		<modification>For a 12&inch; Dutch oven, it takes about 1&frac12; times this recipe, but we tend to just double it and use a deeper Dutch oven.</modification>
