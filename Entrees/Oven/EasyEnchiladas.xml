	<Notes id="Notes">
		<note>
			Cheap frozen burritos work great for this recipe.
			I always buy the cheap family packs that have about a dozen burritos.
		</note>
		<note>If the burritos are small, you may need to use more to get them to touch all the way across.</note>
		<note>
			It is no problem to have the burritos lean against each other, but it can increase the cooking time.
			For example, 8 burritos in an 8&inch; &by; 8&inch; pan can take a full hour to cook.
