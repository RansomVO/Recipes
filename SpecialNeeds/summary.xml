<Summary> The VanOrmans have a number of family members that have dietary restrictions. <ul>
		<li>Some are diabetic, and need to control the amount of sugar in their diets.</li>
		<li>Some are Lactose Intolerant and need to keep milk out of their diets.</li>
		<li> Some have Gluten Sensitivity or in some cases have Celiac Disease, so they need to completely avoid Gluten.<br />In fact, some are so sensitive, we have to make sure to use a separate spoon when stirring, and to change pans when preparing ingredients for their recipes. </li>
	</ul> To accommodate these people, we have to use separate recipes, or even create a completely different dish for them.<br />This section goes over what we do to try new recipes, and has recipes that are for them! </Summary>
