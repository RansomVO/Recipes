	<Description id="Description"> This is Ransom's second Chili recipe. The first one, <a href=".../SlowCooker/StealthAttackChili.xml">Entrees / Slow Cooker: Stealth-Attack Chili</a>, was really good, but it was complex and actually had to be started the day before you wanted to eat it. On top of that, when we moved to Washington, nobody could handle it. &smiley; <br /> This recipe is geared towards quick preparation, and 7 out of 8 times it actually won the first-place award at a Boy Scout district Dutch-Oven Chili cook-off at Klondike Derbies! </Description>

	<Notes id="Notes">
		<note>
			Cilantro purchased from the grocery store comes in a bunch of stems.
			The leaves need to be picked from the stems and the stems can be discarded.
			Then the leaves need to be chopped.
		</note>
		<note> The Onions and Peppers should be cut into chunks that are as large as possible, but still easy to get into a spoon. <ul>
				<li>1" &times; 1" is too big.</li>
				<li>&frac18;" &times; &frac18;" is too small.</li>
			</ul>
			<span class="NOTE">(We generally use &frac12;" &times; &frac12;", but don't hesitate to make them bigger if you want.)</span>
		</note>
		<note> After chopping the Peppers, <span class="EMPHASIZE">be very careful to <span class="SUPER_EMPHASIZE">not</span> rub your eyes!</span> Even after washing your hands thoroughly, the spicy oils will still be there, and it will <span class="SUPER_EMPHASIZE">hurt!</span></note>
