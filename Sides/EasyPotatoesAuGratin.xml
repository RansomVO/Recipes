	<Description id="Description"> In Utah, just about everybody has a variation of this recipe. We once had a Stake cookbook that had about 10 versions. <br /> Of course, it has lots of names too: Cheesy Potatoes, Cheesy Hash, Funeral Potatoes <span class="SMALL_NOTE">(Because it was a standard dish people brought for the family at the after funeral meal.)</span>. I like the name used here because it lends at least <span class="HIGHLIGHT">some</span> respect to the dish. </Description>

	<Notes id="Notes">
		<note>A cheese grater is ideal for "coarsely shredding" the Potatoes.</note>
		<note>
			It doesn't have to be "Ritz" Crackers, but Saltines do not taste very good.
			In general, stick to round Crackers that come in 3-4 tubes to a box.
		</note>
		<note>Do <span class="SUPER_EMPHASIZE">not</span> mix the Crackers and Butter until <span class="EMPHASIZE">just before</span> you spread it over potatoes. Otherwise you will end up with a paste instead of a crumbly topping.</note>

	<Modifications id="Modifications">
		<modification>Use Corn Flakes <span class="NOTE">(with or without butter)</span> instead of Crackers. <span class="NOTE">(Not my favorite.)</span></modification>
		<modification>Use Cheddar Cheese instead of Cheddar-Jack Cheese. <span class="NOTE">(Good, but less tangy.)</span></modification>
		<modification>Use regular Onions instead of Green Onions. <span class="NOTE">(Changes the taste significantly, but it is still good).</span></modification>
		<modification>Instead of shredding the Potatoes, slice them thinly, or cut them into &frac14;&inch;-&frac12;&inch; cubes.<br /><span class="NOTE">(Add 10 minutes cooking time for cubes.)</span></modification>
		<modification>Instead of fresh Potatoes, use frozen Hash Brown Potatoes. <span class="NOTE">(Changes consistency, but it's really easy.)</span></modification>
