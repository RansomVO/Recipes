	<Description id="Description"> We have a family tradition of having home-made pizza every year on Halloween. This recipe is an adaptation of <a href=".../Camping/DO_DutchFathersPizza.xml">Dutch Oven and other Camping Recipes: Dutch Father's Pizza</a> that Grandpa John invented for Dutch ovens, but modified so we can cook it indoors. </Description>

		<note>If time is short, you can just buy a simple spaghetti sauce to use for the pizza sauce, but if you do, don't get chunky sauce because it is hard to spread evenly over the crust.</note>
		<note>Use left-over sauce as a dipping sauce for the pizza crusts.</note>
