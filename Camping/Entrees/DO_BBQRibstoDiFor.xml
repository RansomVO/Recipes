	<Description id="Description"> Before they were married Di and Ransom had a BBQ Rips bake-off with missionaries as the judges. Ransom did the <a href=".../Entrees/SlowCooker/BBQSpareRibs.xml">Slow Cooker BBQ Spare Ribs</a> recipe. Di won, but then <span class="NOTE">(a long time later)</span> Di told Ransom that her sauce recipe was something like: "Buy a bottle of Tony Roma BBQ Sauce".<br />Ransom tried her cooking method and found it did give the ribs a great consistency, so, after several attempts, we came up with <a href=".../Entrees/Oven/BBQRibsToDiFor.xml">BBQ Ribs to Di For</a>. <br />Then we modified it slightly to go in a Dutch Oven and it turned out <span class="EMPHASIZE">great!</span>
