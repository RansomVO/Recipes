	<Notes>
		<note>In Step 3, if you add the powder directly into the Boiling Water, it may "flash boil". <br />This will cause it to spray all over and somebody usually gets burned.<br /><span class="NOTE">(Believe me, I learned the hard way!)</span></note>
		<note>In Step 5, we use molds for "Jello Jigglers" that are about the size of jelly beans. We have also seen some cool candy molds that would work well. <br /> If you don't have molds, you can pour the mixure into a 8" &times; 8" pan, then cut it into strips after it sets. </note>
